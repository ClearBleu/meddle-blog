# meddle-blog
# A simple CRUD blog website that allows users to post, read, update, and delete blog articles.

# See latest commits for most recent changes.

# Don't forget to download the node modules for this application:
# $npm i ejs express pg dotenv

# No longer supports UUID generation. All IDs are generated by the database.

# I used a .env file to store my sensitive information, I recommend anyone wanting to fork to do the same.
# I also encourage everyone to use the database of their choice. I went with PostgreSQL relational database for this project.

# I'd love feedback on the app so far
# I have future plans to convert into React app (I know I'm crazy lol)
